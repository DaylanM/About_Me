    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am an aspiring web developer. I have an extensive job background from a Scout Camping Instructor to CNC operator/Shipping and receiving and currently working as IT for audit companies. I played soccer and tennis through high school. Unfortunately due to medical reasons I was unable to continue these activites after High School. I then attended UVU and eventually I decided to specifically pursue web development. I have a multiple friends who graduated from Devpoint so that is what led me here.
